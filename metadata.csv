AccessPoint,To provide emergency services with additional information on accessing locations.,"Access and Entrance Points were field collected. There is no known source available to compare the field collected data, either for spatial location or attribute accuracy. Access points are primarily along the street and represent a point of access to one or more entrances of a building. In some cases, they are also in the interior of a building complex, because of internal fences or gates. In other cases, an access point represents access to an alley or walkway in the rear or side of a building."
AddressPoint,Address points were developed to supplement the address information supplied by the CSCL centerline. Some computer aided dispatch systems use address points as the primary source for locating an address.,"Address points were initially created from data in the Department of City Planning Property Address Directory (PAD) file. Points were created approximately five feet inside building footprints along the correct street frontage. A field collection/verification process was undertaken to validate ""multi-valued"" addresses contained in the PAD file (i.e. those locations with a range of addresses). Additionally, a statistical sample of PAD single valued addresses was field checked. Approximately 100,000 locations were visited (about 10% of the total)."

AtomicPolygon,To generate Atomic Polygon-based district hierarchies.,"Atomic polygons serve as a set of basic building blocks for generating the polygons of many of the district types represented in the CSCL database.

Sources for the data include: - NYPD (Sprint and PCAD) - FDNY (Starfire and EMSCAD) - OEM Hospitals - DCP Special Address File - DoITT - Points of Interest, NYCHA developments, Schools - DPR Parks Properties Points were either loaded from a previously existing point feature class or they were created. The different methods to create the points include: manual location based on Orthophotography, buildings and/or parcels based on an address or known location, automatically using ArcMap functions, or by entering the centerline XY corrdinate of the location from Geosupport."
Complex,To create areas that represent major complexes throughout the City.,"Complex is a polygon representation of New York City complexes including colleges, hospitals, rail yards, parks, commercial centers, and other govermental buildings campuses. Each complex has a corresponding common place point, which must be linked to in order to get relevant information such as name, street code (B7SC), and SAF Type."

EMSAtom,"This data is supplied to provide map area coverage used by EMSCAD software to determine the location and EMS_Atom of EMS Units based on locations reported via on-board vehicle location (GPS) systems. This map is NOT intended to provide a ""pretty"" map display used for reporting purposes. It purpose is to cover all areas where a Unit might be reported. Coverage extends beyond the 5 borough area of NYC to account for unit locations outside the area involving mutual aid and transport to or from various medical facilities outside the 5 borough area. Updates and corrections to EMS Atom boundaries in this version are based on data obtained from: a) Atom area paper map set, (Original Atom maps, scanned and georeferenced) b) EMSCAD blockface file data, c) FDNY GIS Review d) Refinement requests by EMS Command.

HurricaneEvacuationZone,Hurricane evacuation zone category (1-6) for locations in New York City.,"New York City's hurricane contingency plans are based on six evacuation zones. Hurricane evacuation zones are areas of the city that may be inundated by storm surge or isolated by storm surge waters. There are six zones, ranked by the risk of storm surge impact, with Zone 1 being the most likely to flood. In the event of a hurricane or tropical storm, residents in these zones may be ordered to evacuate."

NAMEDINTERSECTION,Provides the ability to serach and find name intersections in the City.,The named intersection table associates nodes (intersections) that have names in the City.
Neighborhood,"Projection areas were created using whole census tracts that were exact subdivisions of New York City's 55 Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). (PUMAs were developed for use with the Census Bureau's Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) and are approximations of Community Districts.) Projection areas were not permitted to cross PUMA boundaries. Users need to be cognizant of the reason why these projection areas were created, and the demographic and geographic constraints inherent in how they were configured.","These 'Neighborhoods' are in essence projection areas created to project populations at a small area level, from 2000 to 2030. First and foremost, these aggregations were driven by population size in 2000 - projection areas had to have a minimum population of 15,000, because this reduces the error associated with the projected population. This criterion resulted in combinations of neighborhoods that probably would not occur if one were solely designating boundaries of historical neighborhoods. Moreover, the neighborhood names associated with the projection areas are not intended to be definitive."
Node,"Nodes are useful for several reasons: 1) Assignment of a value to an intersection (e.g. reference an incident to an intersection, 2) Used to help assign location to other CSCSL datasets (e.g. Virtual Intersections, Special Intersections) and 3) Required for data editing to support Geosupport.",Nodes represent the locations of any combination of linear features in CSCL (a topological junction).

This data was geocoded using the Dept. of City Planning’s Geosupport batch geocoding tool (GBAT). All the Melissa records that represented single addresses (apartments or units) were removed.The original USPS Melissa data came with a single field for the “unit” called “SUITE”. The data in SUITE was parsed into the NENA NG911 CLDXF fields (BUILDING, FLOOR, UNIT, ROOM, SEAT, ADDITIONAL_LOC_INFO). The original text in the SUITE field was retained in the SUBADDRESS table field “MELISSA_SUITE”.This data has been updated current to the 2021 USPS Melissa data."

CDTA2020,,The Department of City Planning (DCP) created Community District Tabulation Areas (CDTAs) to closely approximate the 59 Community Districts of New York City for the purpose of reporting American Community Survey (ACS) data. CDTAs are built by aggregating whole 2020 census tracts.
NTA2020,,"2020 and 2010 Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) are medium-sized statistical geographies for reporting Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS). 2020 NTAs are created by aggregating 2020 census tracts and nest within Community District Tabulation Areas (CDTA). NTAs were delineated with the need for both geographic specificity and statistical reliability in mind. Consequently, each NTA contains enough population to mitigate sampling error associated with the ACS yet offers a unit of analysis that is smaller than a Community District."
